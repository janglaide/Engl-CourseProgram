Passive Voice
In general we tend to use the active voice. 
That is when a subject does an action to an object.
The passive voice is used when we want to emphasize the action (the verb) 
and the object of a sentence rather than subject. 
This means that the subject is either less important 
than the action itself or that we don`t know who or what the subject is.
When we know who the subject is, we put it at the end with by. 
We call this an agent.
Most writing instructors and editors recommend against 
using the passive voice, when possible. 
The reason for this is that when you use the active voice, 
your writing is clearer and less complicated.
The passive is often used to report something or to state a fact.
The passive voice is not a tense in English. 
Each tense has its own passive voice 
which is created by using 
a form of the auxiliary verb to be + V3 (past participle)

Present simple
am, is, are + V3	
Present progressive
am, is, are + being + V3
Past simple
was, were + invited
Past progressive
was, were + being + V3
Future (will)
will be + V3
Future (going to)
am, is, are + going to be + V3	
Present perfect
has, have + been + V3
Past perfect
had + been + V3
Future perfect
will + have been + V3
Modals: can/could
can, could + be + V3
Modal: have to
have to, has to, had to + be + V3
