Past modal verbs of deduction
We can use modal verbs to say if we believe something is certain or probable.
must = 90-100% sure it`s true
can`t = 90-100% sure it isn`t true
might/may = 30-50% perhaps it`s true
might not/may not = 30-50% perhaps it isn`t true

But the forms above are used to speculate about the present or future. 
If we want to talk about the past, we need to use 
the perfect forms of the modal verbs.
We use must have + past participle to say 
that we are quite sure that something was true or happened in the past.
We use can`t/couldn`t have + past participle to say 
that we are quite sure that something did NOT happen 
or was NOT true in the past.
We use might/may have + past participle to say 
that it’s possible that something was true or happened in the past.
We use should have/ought to have + past participle to talk 
about a situation expected to happen in the past. 
This form is normally used for criticism.
