1. CLAUSES OF CONTRAST

We can use ALTHOUGH/EVEN THOUGH at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence followed by a clause (subject + verb). We NEVER use a comma after although or event though.

We use HOWEVER to connect two different sentences. We normally use however at the beginning of the second sentence after a full stop (.) or a semi-colon (;). However is ALWAYS followed by a comma

DESPITE AND IN SPITE OF are normally followed by a noun or a `ing verb. They can go at the beginning or in the middle of the sentence. 


2. CLAUSES OF PURPOSE

The most common way to express purpose in English is TO + INFINITIVE.

IN ORDER TO OR SO AS TO + INFINITIVE are more common in formal English, mainly in writing. The negative forms are in order not to and so as not to + infinitive. 

We can also use SO THAT + SUBJECT + VERB to express purpose. We normally use a modal verb with this connector, e.g. could, can, would, etc.

We can also use FOR + NOUN to express purpose.

To express purpose, we can also use IN CASE + SUBJECT + VERB. We use this form to talk about precautions, when we do something because something not wanted might happen.


3. CLAUSES OF REASON

When we want to explain the reason why something happened or why someone did something, we use a clause of reason introduced by a conjunction (as, since, because) or a noun phrase introduced by because of, due to, owing to, or on account of.

We use BECAUSE before a clause (subject + verb).  It can be used at the beginning or at the end of a sentence (at the end is more common). A comma is used when the clause of reason is at the beginning of the sentence.

We use AS AND SINCE in a very similar way to because. They are followed by subject + verb and can be used at the beginning or at the end of a sentence. However, as and since are more formal expressions, and more common in written than in spoken English.

We use BECAUSE OF before a noun.

We can also use DUE TO/OWING TO/ON ACCOUNT OF before a noun. They mean `because of` but are more formal.


4. CLAUSES OF RESULT
We use clauses of result to talk about the result of an action or situation.

We can use SO + SUBJECT + VERB at the end of a sentence to mean `this is why`.

We normally use FOR THIS REASON at the beginning of a sentence. We use a comma after it.

AS A RESULT, CONSEQUENTLY AND THEREFORE are more formal and more common in written language. They are normally used at the beginning of a sentence, followed by a comma.
