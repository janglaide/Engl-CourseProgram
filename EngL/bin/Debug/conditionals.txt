if clause and main clause
All conditional sentences have two parts: 
the if clause and the main clause. 
It doesn`t matter which clause comes first, 
but when the if clause comes first, we should put a comma after it.

In zero conditional sentences, the tense in both parts of the sentence is the simple present.
As in all conditional sentences, the order of the clauses is not fixed. 
You may have to rearrange the pronouns and adjust punctuation 
when you change the order of the clauses, but the meaning is identical.
In zero conditional sentences, you can replace "if" with "when", 
because both express general truths. The meaning will be unchanged.

First conditional, future time clauses
if + present, future
In the first conditional, the verb in the if clause is present and the verb in the main clause is future (will).
When we use a verb after when, as soon as, before, afteror until to talk about the future,
we have to use this verb in present tense (NOT future).
We use the future in the other part of the sentence.
Similar to first conditional
Future time clauses are similar to the first conditional. There`s a main clause and a when/after/etc. clause.
We use the verbs in these clauses like in the first conditional.
We use a comma when the when/after/etc. clause is at the beginning of the sentence. 
But we don`t use a comma if the when/after` clause is at the end of the sentence.

Second conditional ` unreal situations
We use if + past to talk about an imaginary present or future situation 
(although the verb is in past, the meaning is present or future). 
And we use would + infinitive to talk about the result or consequence of that imaginary situation.
We can also use unless in conditional sentences to mean if ` (not)
In the main clause, we can use could or might instead of would.
In the second conditional we can use if I/he/she/it were (more formal) instead of if I/he/she/it was.
But we use were (NOT was) when we give advice with the expression if I were you.

We use the first conditional to talk about possible situations, things that may easily happen. 
We use the second conditional to talk about unrealistic situations.
If I see Sara, I`ll tell her to call you. (=possible)
If I won the lottery, I`d buy a new house.  (=unrealistic)
Sometimes we use either the first or second conditional, and we use one or the other 
depending on how probable we think the situations are to happen.

Third conditional ` past unreal situations
We use if + past perfect to talk about an imaginary or hypothetical situation in the past. 
And we use would have, could have or might have + past participle in the main clause
to talk about the result or consequence of that imaginary situation.
We can also use unless in conditional sentences to mean if ` (not)
