For the present simple we need to use the verb do/does in questions and don`t/doesn`t in negatives.
We use the present tense:
1. For repeated or regular actions in the present time period.
2. For facts.
3. For habits.
4. For things that are always / generally true.
We form the present tense using the base form of the infinitive (without the TO).
In general, in the third person we add 'S' in the third person.
The spelling for the verb in the third person differs depending on the ending of that verb:
1. For verbs that end in -O, -CH, -SH, -SS, -X, or -Z we add -ES in the third person.
2. For verbs that end in a consonant + Y, we remove the Y and add -IES.
NOTE: For verbs that end in a vowel + Y, we just add -S.
To make a negative sentence in English we normally use Don't or Doesn't with all verbs 
EXCEPT To Be and Modal verbs (can, might, should etc.).
You will see that we add don't between the subject and the verb. 
We use Don't when the subject is I, you, we or they.
When the subject is he, she or it, we add doesn't between the subject and the verb to make a negative sentence. 
Notice that the letter S at the end of the verb in the affirmative sentence (because it is in third person) disappears in the negative sentence.
Example of Negative Sentence with Don't and Doesn't:
You don't speak Arabic.
