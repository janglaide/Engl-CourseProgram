Past simple ` regular/irregular verbs
Past simple regular
We often add -ed to verbs (regular verbs) to make the past simple.
We double the consonant when the verb ends in consonant + vowel + consonant. 
This is always true when the verb is one syllable.
When the verb is two syllables, 
we only double the consonant when the STRESS is in the last syllable.
But we do NOT double the consonant 
when the STRESS is NOT in the last syllable.
