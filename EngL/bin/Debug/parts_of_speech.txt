The parts of speech explain how a word is used in a sentence.
There are eight main parts of speech (also known as word classes): 
NOUN - (Naming word)
A noun is the name of a person, place, thing or idea.
PRONOUN - (Replaces a Noun)
A pronoun is used in place of a noun or noun phrase to avoid repetition.
ADJECTIVE - (Describing word)
An adjective describes, modifies or gives more information about a noun or pronoun.
VERB - (Action Word)
A verb shows an action or state of being. A verb shows what someone or something is doing.
ADVERB - (Describes a verb)
An adverb describes/modifies a verb, an adjective or another adverb. 
It tells how, where, when, how often or to what extent. Many adverbs end in -LY
PREPOSITION - (Shows relationship)
A preposition shows the relationship of a noun or pronoun to another word. 
They can indicate time, place, or relationship.
CONJUNCTION - (Joining word)
A conjunction joins two words, ideas, phrases or clauses together 
in a sentence and shows how they are connected.
INTERJECTION - (Expressive word)
An interjection is a word or phrase that expresses a strong feeling or emotion. 
It is a short exclamation.

Adjectives in English
Adjective + noun
When we use adjectives with a noun in English, the adjectives go before the noun.
am/is/are + adjective
We can also use adjectives without a noun after the verb be.
In questions the adjective can go after be + subject.
feel/look/smell/sound/taste + adjective
We can also use adjectives without a noun after the verbs of the senses: 
feel, look, smell, sound, taste.
Adjectives in English have no plural. They are always singular.
We can use very and quite before the adjectives.
Possessive adjectives are used to show possession or ownership of something. 
While we use them when we refer to people, it is more in the sense of relationship than ownership.
I	me	 
You	you	 
He	him	 
She	her	 
It	it	 
We	us	 
They	them
Possessive adjectives are always singular.
We use possessive adjectives:
1. to show something belongs to somebody
2. for relations and friends
3. for parts of the body
NOTE: Its = possessive adjective. It`s = it is (subject + verb be)

We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, 
another adverb, a clause or a whole sentence and, less commonly, about a noun phrase.
Adverbs of manner
We use adverbs of manner after after a verb to describe the verb. 
We use an adverb of manner to say how something happens or how we do something.
Adverbs of frequency
We use adverbs of frequency with the present simple to talk about how often something happens.
Adverbs of frequency go before the verb, but after the verb be.
The adverbs never and hardly ever (=almost never) have a negative meaning, 
There are other expressions that we use to talk about frequency: 
once a day, twice a week, three times a month, every day, etc. 
These expressions are longer (2 words or more) and they go at the end of the sentence,
but they are used with a positive verb.

Adverbs of manner vs adjectives
We use adjectives to describe a noun (before a noun or after the verb be), 
and we use adverbs of manner to describe a verb (after the verb or verb + object).

Adjectives ending in -ly
Some words end in -ly, but they are adjectives, NOT adverbs: 
friendly, lovely, silly. We CANNOT transform these adjectives into adverbs of manner.
