Wishes and regrets ` I wish / if only

I wish I did
We can use wish + subject + past simple 
to talk about things 
that we would like to be different in the present or future 
(but which are very unlikely or not possible).

I wish I had done
We can use wish + subject + past perfect 
to talk about things that happened 
in the past and that we regret 
(we would have wanted them to be different).

I wish you would do
We can use wish + person/thing + would + infinitive 
when we talk about situations 
that annoy us and we would like them to change, or to stop.
We CANNOT use this structure to wish about ourselves 
(do NOT use I wish I would).

If only
We can use if only instead of I wish 
with a very similar meaning. 
The only difference is that if only is more emphatic.
